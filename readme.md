## Take a sad chart and make it better

This repository is linked with the [RStudio Cloud project](https://rstudio.cloud/project/1893495) for the hands-on portion of the [visualization workshop](https://slides.com/trang1618/take-a-sad-chart-and-make-it-better) at the RLadies Philly [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-philly/events/268783170/) on December 8, 2020.

The main file is [`covid-dataviz.Rmd`](covid-dataviz.Rmd).
If you finish all the exercises, please feel free to browse around: 
there are a few nuggets of code/visualization that I think you'll like.

Thanks for attending!
